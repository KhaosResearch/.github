## Hi there 👋

The Khaos Research group of the University of Malaga focuses its research activity on the management, integration and analysis of data and Big Data. It works at the intersection of technologies related to large-scale data management and integration, W3C data standards, data analytics technologies, optimization with meta-heuristics and Big Data analysis. It emphasizes the application of research results to real problems, especially in health and agrifood. Within the previous context, the current research proposal focuses on the exploitation of domain semantics in the algorithms and workflows of Big Data analysis.
